       <h2>On of our Partner Charities:</h2>
      <h4>Tynker wants to bring coding education to all children. </h4>
        <p>Most classic information technology education offerings are outdated and very superficial. They are not age-appropriate, self-paced and often turn interested minds away from coding. Tynker wants to change that, and bring coding-lessons everywhere people have screens and an internet connection. </p>
        <p>Tynkers projects have a very long run time, and after the initial investment, they need very little funds to keep afloat. Together with LongTermGiving, they plan to be self-sufficient until the end of 2022. This means they can operate indefinitely with the dividends matching their expenses. If they raise sufficient money on top of their ongoing costs, they can simply design and code another course and add it to their stack.</p>
